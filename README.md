* projects are relevant and provide value.
* projects represent developers at Exxeta.
* projects can be used as a reference and to showcase our work.

### Project criteria

* has designated project owner who works with Exxeta.
* work is licensed under an [open source license](https://choosealicense.com/).
* README tells other people why the project is useful, what they can do with the project, and how they can use it.
* not just a fork (to submit a PR)

### Soft project criteria and goals

* good documentation
* active development
* popular (forks & stars)

## Our commitment to quality
		
### Housekeeping

This effort is driven by a Exxeta github orga team and carried out in tight cooperation with project owners.
Our goal is to assert that all public projects in github.com/EXXETA meet the above criteria.

This can be done by:
* mentoring & contributing
* archiving inactive repositories,
* reducing the visibility of repositories,
* migrating repositories to our internal gitlab server,
* deleting irrelevant repositories

### Onboarding new projects
				
1. Please start a discussion in our tech.io > github team channel
2. We will contact you to create/import your project with private visibility.
3. We will mentor you to meet all the above criteria.
4. We will publish your project at github.com/EXXETA and help you promote it using (at least) Exxeta internal communication channels.
