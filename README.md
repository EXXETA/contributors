# How to contribute to the github.com/EXXETA presence

## Our vision for github.com/EXXETA

* projects are relevant and provide value.
* projects represent developers at EXXETA.
* projects can be used as a reference and to showcase our work.

### Hard project criteria

* has designated project owner who works with EXXETA.
* work is licensed under an [open source license](https://choosealicense.com/).
* README tells other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

### Soft project criteria

* good documentation
* active development
* popular (forks & stars)
* not just a fork (to submit a PR)

## Our commitment to quality
		
### Housekeeping

This effort is driven by a EXXETA github orga team and carried out in tight cooperation with project owners.
Our goal is to assert that all public projects in github.com/EXXETA meet the above criteria.

This can be done by:
* mentoring & contributing
* archiving inactive repositories,
* reducing the visibility of repositories,
* migrating repositories to our internal gitlab server,
* deleting irrelevant repositories

### Onboarding new projects
				
1. Please start a discussion in [tech.io > github channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aec08489e04414ee2b32565c6e83086dc%40thread.tacv2/Github?groupId=af8f4d8d-5ae3-49b5-a2ba-7f47adf89bf1&tenantId=338159a0-dd8f-45af-9672-faaa54bc6b24)
